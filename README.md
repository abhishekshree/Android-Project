# Android-Project

Created this chat application as a part of learning android development.

This app is based on Java and is powered by Firebase. Also picked up features from instagram and whatsapp and tried to clib them here.
Learned how firebase auth, storage and database works. Also learned to implement recyclerView in applications.
The next goal is to implement calling functionality in the App.
